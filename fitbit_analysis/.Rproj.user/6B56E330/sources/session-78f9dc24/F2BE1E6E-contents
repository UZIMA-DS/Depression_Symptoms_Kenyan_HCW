## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#sleep_log <- dbReadTable(con, "FactFitBitSleepLog")
dim(sleep_log)
# -68974 23      as per 29th/June

## check column names and clean
names(sleep_log)
sleep_log <- clean_names(sleep_log)

# First sleep analysis, the following variables were slelected.


columns  <- c('participant_identifier','start_date','efficiency','minutes_asleep',
              'sleep_level_light','sleep_level_deep','sleep_level_rem')
sleep_minutes <- sleep_log[, columns, drop =FALSE]
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
